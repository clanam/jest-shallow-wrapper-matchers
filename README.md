# jest-shallow-wrapper-matchers
Jest matchers for enzyme shallow wrappers.

Moving this here so I can reuse between react-native doodle projects without having to
rewrite it every time I want to add a test. Don't think anyone else should want this
unless they're also on react native and also can't figure out how to get the mounting
shims to work. 🤷‍♀️
